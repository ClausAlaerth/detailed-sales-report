## Project Challenge - Detailed Sales Report with Bookmarks

The challenge involved the replication of the first page of the report, where the instructor taught the use of Bookmarks as filters for changing the charts dynamically. In the second page, the students needed to develop charts with nothing but what was previously shown before, making use of bookmarks, filters and custom made charts, like those of Chiclet Slicer.
